# What's this?
This repo is just another *very* useful and serious project for my beloved university.
It was part of the class on Big Data.

# How to run?
To run this you can just clone it then run:
1. init.sh - This just downloads data and sets up other scripts
2. map-reduce.sh - Take a wild guess at what this does.
3. hive.sh - Are you for real? wow.

# State
Works somehow, generates some output, but I can't be bothered enough to check if it's ok.
